    title: "Marinara",
description: "Like the margherita pizza, pizza marinara also originated in Naples. This simple pizza is topped with plain marinara sauce, oregano and garlic. Essentially, it is very similar to the margherita pizza but lacks the cheese and basil. Apparently, back in the 1700s and 1800s, pizza marinara was popular with poor sailors and made on their ships as the ingredients used to make it were easily preserved.",
